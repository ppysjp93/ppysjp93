- 👋 Hi, I’m @ppysjp93 aka Samuel James Palmer
- 👀 I’m interested in Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (aka SICP), amazing book, heavy lifting but huge return on efforts
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Scheme, a lisp which is used as the language to tutor the complex books covered in SICP
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on OpenSource Linux Projects, in particular any projects using Clojure!
