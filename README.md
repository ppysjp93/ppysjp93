- 👋 Hi, I’m @ppysjp93 aka Samuel James Palmer
- 👀 I’m interested in Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (aka SICP), amazing book, heavy lifting but huge return on efforts
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Scheme, a LISP programming language which is used as the language to tutor the complex books covered in SICP
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on OpenSource Linux Projects, in particular any projects using Clojure! 
- 📫 How to reach me: sam.palmer93@googlemail.com

Please feel free to look at my solutions in my SICP repository, there are a variety of really interesting problems that will bend your brain
but dramatically improve your understanding of managing abstractions! 

Here is a link to the book site: https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html
